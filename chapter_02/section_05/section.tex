\subsection{Boot Process of STM32H755ZI}

There are three power domains. CM7 and CM4 lies in the D1 and D2 domains respectively. Circuits
that are responsible for power up and clock generation lies in the D3 domain. RCC\footnote{Reset and Clock Controller}
is responsible for processing reset and generating clock to the CM7 and CM4. In essence, RCC boots up the
cores.

\subsubsection{BOOT0 Pin and BOOT\_ADDx Registers}

Boot0 pin enables the user to boot from a factory configured bootloader\footnote{Non user programmable.} if it is
set to 1. Otherwise BOOT\_ADDx registers chooses the boot location of each of the cores.

\alertNote{
    There are two system memory banks. Each one is of size 128 K.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bank 1: Located at \texttt{0x1FF0 0000}.
        \item Bank 2: Located at \texttt{0x1FF4 0000}.
