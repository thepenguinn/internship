\subsection{USB On The Go (Continued)}

\subsubsection{Hardware Side Specific to STM32H755ZI}

The device is capable of USB HS through an external PHY. It already has an embedded USB FS PHY.
The nucleo board is capable of USB FS as it does not have an external USB HS PHY. In STM32H7, there
are two instances of OTG\_HS, namely OTG\_HS1 and OTG\_HS2. Only the OTG\_HS1 instance is capable of
achieving USB HS through an external PHY.

The device has 4Kb of USB data RAM with advanced FIFO\footnote{First in first out} control. This
memory can be partitioned by the user for each of the endpoints.

\subsubsection{OTG\_HS Core}

OTG\_HS receives the 48 MHz from the RCC\footnote{Reset and Clock Controller}. There are different
registers associated with the OTG\_HS core that helps to control the core.
