\subsection{UART - I2C Exercise}

\paragraph{Exercise Question:} Configure two UART interfaces, one I2C interfaces and an onboard
LED.

Based on the command received location:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If command received from ST-LINK's UART, then relay that to the other UART.
    \item If command received from the other UART, then relay that to the I2C.
    \item If command received from I2C, do as such to the LED.
\end{itemize}

Then connect the other UART and I2C to another STM32 and test.
